## 📌 Overview

**Craft v2.0** is a production-oriented microservices evolution of the original Craft platform: a multi-vendor handcraft marketplace combined with e-learning, real-time communication, delivery workflows, analytics, support operations, and intelligent recommendations.

This version moves the platform from a modular monolithic backend into a distributed microservices ecosystem where each business domain is isolated, independently deployable, and designed for scalability.

Craft v2.0 focuses on:

- 🧩 Domain-driven microservice separation
- 🚪 Centralized API Gateway routing with Traefik
- 🔐 Dedicated authentication and RBAC service
- 🛒 Independent catalog, order, payment, platform, and reporting services
- ⚡ FastAPI-based real-time notification service
- 🤖 FastAPI-based recommendation and ML service
- 🐳 Full Docker Compose orchestration
- 📊 Prometheus and Grafana observability
- ♻️ Shared internal Python package for common logic

---

## 🧠 From Monolith to Microservices

Previous Craft versions focused on building a large production-ready Django backend with e-commerce, e-learning, chat, delivery, analytics, security, support tickets, disputes, recommendations, audit logs, and GDPR-oriented privacy features.

**Craft v2.0** restructures these capabilities into independent services to improve:

| Area | Improvement |
|---|---|
| Scalability | Scale heavy services independently, such as orders, real-time notifications, or ML recommendations |
| Maintainability | Smaller codebases per domain with clearer ownership |
| Deployment | Deploy, rebuild, or restart one service without affecting the full platform |
| Reliability | Failure in one service is isolated from the rest of the system |
| Team Workflow | Multiple developers can work on different services in parallel |
| Security | Sensitive domains such as authentication and payments are isolated |
| Observability | Metrics and logs can be tracked per service |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Craft v2.0 is composed of multiple backend services communicating through HTTP APIs and internal service clients. External traffic enters through **Traefik**, which acts as the API Gateway and routes requests based on path prefixes.

```text
Client Apps
    |
    v
Traefik API Gateway
    |
    |-- /api/auth/        -> Auth Service
    |-- /api/catalog/     -> Catalog Service
    |-- /api/orders/      -> Order Service
    |-- /api/payments/    -> Payment Service
    |-- /api/platform/    -> Platform Service
    |-- /api/reports/     -> Reporting Service
    |-- /ws/              -> Realtime Service
    |-- /api/ml/          -> ML Service
    |
    v
Independent Databases, Redis, Monitoring, and Internal Services
```

---

## 🚪 API Gateway Routing

Craft uses **Traefik** as a reverse proxy and API Gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> **WIP Note:** The Traefik container routing configuration is currently being finalized. For local development, you may access services via their direct mapped ports or via the centralized Admin Service until the Gateway is fully deployed.

| Public Path | Routed Service |
|---|---|
| `/admin/`, `/docs/` | Admin Service |
| `/api/auth/` | Auth Service |
| `/api/catalog/` | Catalog Service |
| `/api/orders/` | Order Service |
| `/api/payments/` | Payment Service |
| `/api/platform/` | Platform Service |
| `/api/reports/` | Reporting Service |
| `/ws/` | Realtime Service |
| `/api/ml/` | ML Service |
| `/dashboard/` | Traefik Dashboard |

Example:

```text
http://localhost/admin/
http://localhost/api/auth/
http://localhost/api/catalog/
http://localhost/api/orders/
http://localhost/api/payments/
```

## ♻️ Shared Library: `craft_common`

`craft_common` is an internal shared Python package mounted into multiple services.

It contains reusable logic such as:

- JWT authentication helpers
- Service-to-service API clients
- Common response formatters
- Shared exception handling
- Logging configuration
- Request correlation ID utilities
- Permission and role helpers
- Common constants and service URLs

This reduces duplication while keeping every microservice independent.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Authentication is centralized in the **Auth Service**.

The Auth Service handles:

- User registration and login
- JWT access and refresh tokens
- Role-Based Access Control
- Profile management
- Supplier, customer, delivery, and admin identities
- Permission validation for protected services

Other services validate incoming tokens using shared utilities from `craft_common`.

## 🚀 Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

This repository is protected by a robust **GitHub Actions** Continuous Integration pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

On every push and pull request to the `main` branch, the CI pipeline automatically:
1. Provisions isolated **PostgreSQL** and **RabbitMQ** services.
2. Checks out the repository and sets up the Python environment.
3. Automatically triggers the test suite for all microservices in a parallel matrix.
4. Builds the individual Docker images for each service to ensure successful compilation.

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker Compose

The full microservices ecosystem can be started using Docker Compose.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Waleeddarwesh/craft-v2-microservices.git
cd craft-v2-microservices
```

### 2️⃣ Create Environment File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the required values inside `.env`, especially:

```ini
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
POSTGRES_USER=craft
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=craft_password
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

### 3️⃣ Build and Start All Services

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### 4️⃣ Check Running Containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### 5️⃣ View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

For a specific service:

```bash
docker compose logs -f auth_service
docker compose logs -f catalog_service
docker compose logs -f realtime_service
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Migrations

Each Django microservice owns its database schema and migrations.

Run all migrations across all services automatically using the provided helper scripts:

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\migrate_all.ps1
```

**On Linux/macOS/Git Bash:**
```bash
bash migrate_all.sh
```

Create an admin user in the Auth Service:

```bash
docker compose exec auth_service python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## 🌱 Seed Demo Data

If demo seed commands are available, run them service by service:

```bash
docker compose exec auth_service python manage.py seed_demo_data
docker compose exec catalog_service python manage.py seed_demo_data
docker compose exec order_service python manage.py seed_demo_data
```

---

## ✅ Service Verification

Run the global verification script:

```bash
bash verify_services.sh
```

The script can be used to check:

- Django configuration validity
- Missing migrations
- Service health
- Environment variable availability
- Import errors
- Basic endpoint readiness

You can also check services manually:

```bash
curl http://localhost/api/auth/health/
curl http://localhost/api/catalog/health/
curl http://localhost/api/orders/health/
curl http://localhost/api/payments/health/
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

Craft v2.0 includes monitoring infrastructure using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**. 

Since observability is resource-heavy, it is separated into its own compose file. To start the monitoring stack alongside the main services, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d
```

| Tool | Purpose | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Traefik Dashboard | Gateway routes and service status | `http://localhost:8080` |
| Prometheus | Metrics collection | `http://localhost:9090` |
| Grafana | Dashboards and visualization | `http://localhost:3000` |

Recommended service metrics:

- Request count
- Response time
- Error rate
- Database availability
- Redis availability
- WebSocket connections
- Payment webhook failures
- Order creation rate
- Recommendation API latency

---

## 🔁 Service Communication

Craft v2.0 supports two communication styles:

### 1. Synchronous HTTP Communication

Used when a service needs immediate data from another service.

Examples:

- Order Service validates product data from Catalog Service
- Payment Service verifies order payment status
- Reporting Service collects aggregated metrics

### 2. Event-Driven Communication

Used for asynchronous workflows and decoupled processing.

Examples:

- Order created → notify user
- Payment succeeded → update order status
- Review approved → update product rating
- Refund processed → notify customer
- Product viewed → update recommendation signals

---

## 🧪 API Documentation

Each service can expose independent API documentation.

Suggested documentation URLs:

```text
http://localhost/docs/ (Secure Centralized API Documentation - requires Admin login)
http://localhost/api/auth/docs/
http://localhost/api/catalog/docs/
http://localhost/api/orders/docs/
http://localhost/api/payments/docs/
http://localhost/api/platform/docs/
http://localhost/api/reports/docs/
http://localhost/ws/docs/
http://localhost/api/ml/docs/
